✅ 160 Days. 1 Language. Countless Problems.

 Guess what? I’ve just completed 160 consecutive days of solving Data Structures & Algorithms on GeeksforGeeks, all in Python! 🐍

Sandeep Jain. Everything I achieved in name of skills and lessons related to Patience, are done in this challenge as well.



This journey wasn’t just about writing code… it was about:

 ✔ Sharpening my problem-solving skills

 ✔ Getting super comfortable with Python for DSA

 ✔ Building discipline & consistency for over 5 months!

Honestly, there were days I felt like skipping… but I didn’t. And trust me, that’s what makes this win special. 💪

Big lesson learned:

 🔑 Consistency beats motivation every single time.

If you’re starting out, here’s my advice:

 👉 Choose one language (Python worked for me)

 👉 Solve every day, even if it’s just one problem

 👉 Don’t break the streak—small steps add up!

Here’s to the next big milestone! 🚀

I want to thank SAURABH VERMA, the person who motivated me to do this challenge.
